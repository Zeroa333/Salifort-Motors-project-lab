Currently, there is a high rate of turnover among Salifort employees. Salifortâ€™s senior leadership team is concerned about how many employees are leaving the company. They strives to create a corporate culture that supports employee success and professional development. Further, the high turnover rate is costly in the financial sense. Salifort makes a big investment in recruiting, training, and upskilling its employees. 
The leadership team wants us to analyze the data and come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they suggest you design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other relevant data points. A good model will help the company increase retention and job satisfaction for current employees, and save money and time training new employees.
